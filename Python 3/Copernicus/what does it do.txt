This code tries to "discover" that the planets orbit the Sun in simple orbits, just like Copernicus did with his observations. To do so, it uses the angle of Mars (theta_M) and the angle of the Sun (theta_S)
as seen from Earth in a certain point in time t0. The code is trained with a certain amount of these observations. 

The python file ed_copernicus starts by selecting observational data. Then, after each time step, SciNet tries to predict where M and S will be with respect to Earth. 


hese angles are labelled as
possible in the code. The next file, ed_copernicus_ellipse, tries to calculate the position of Mars from the true anomaly of both Mars and Earth. 

The second code uses the true anomaly from both E and M to calculate their theta values. then it calculates the heliocentric coordinates of these planets and gives a value of theta S.
